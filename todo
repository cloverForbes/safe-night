Global Regulations and Rules for employes will be democratically by the central organization.
Any rules and regulation can be challenged by a representative of a  city if that person
has held a vote in their city and has atleast 1/2 of the vote. It will then be brought
in front of the central comittee where it will then go to other cities and be held to a vote.
This vote must have atleast a 2/3 majority in favor of the rule change.
